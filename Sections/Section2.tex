\section{First order Roe scheme}

\label{sec:first_order_roe_scheme} 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Explain how to choose m(x,0), to make a single pulse (not two!) based on the linearized problem. 
		
		You can make it a single pulse by giving the wave an initial speed proportional to its height in one direction. Since $m=hv$, we can set m to $hc$, where $c=\sqrt(gH)$, and $H=0$ since we want a linearized approximation.
		
		\item Use this initial data and run the Roe solver with n=80, 160, 320 and the CFL number as large as possible without instability, until the wave has been fully reflected at L. Plot the wave shapes. 
		
		Figure~\ref{fig:Figure21} shows the plots using different N values.  The N value seemed to affect the sharpness of the front edge of the wave. As N increased, the sharpness increased.

			\label{fig:Figure21}
		\end{figure}
		
		\item Compare with solutions obtained using your Lax-Friedrichs solver from HW2. 
		
		The solution obtained here looks very similar to the Lax-Friedrichs solver from HW2 as the shape of the wave forms a sharp edge and looks like a triangle instead of a Gaussian.  This solution isn't stable at the CFL condition and we must make the time step a little smaller.  The Lax-Friedrich solution was also not stable at the CFL condition, but I was forced to decrease the time step by a much larger amount in order to see stability for a few seconds.
		\item Comment about order of accuracy, dissipation and dispersion. 
		
		
		\item Then try also a higher pulse, say a = 2H. Comment on how well the single pulse initial data works.
