\section{Boundary conditions} % (fold)
\label{sec:boundary_conditions}
If the flow is sub-critical, $|u(x)<\sqrt{gh(x)}$, then for Dirichlet boundary conditions, we should set $h(x)$ to be large enough to satisfy the sub-critical condition at the boundaries.  The same should be done for super-critical conditions at the boundaries.
